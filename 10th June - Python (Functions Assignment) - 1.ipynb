    "Lambda functions, also known as anonymous functions, are a way to create small, one-line functions in Python. They are defined using the `lambda` keyword, followed by a set of parameters, a colon, and an expression. Lambda functions are typically used for simple, one-time operations where creating a named function using `def` would be unnecessary.\n",
    "The main differences between lambda functions and regular functions are:\n",
    "1. Syntax: Lambda functions are defined using the `lambda` keyword and are written as a single line of code. Regular functions are defined using the `def` keyword and can span multiple lines.\n",
    "2. Function Name: Lambda functions are anonymous, meaning they do not have a name associated with them. They are usually assigned to a variable or used as an argument within other functions. Regular functions have a name by which they can be called.\n",
    "Here's an example where a lambda function can be useful. Let's say you have a list of numbers and you want to sort them based on their absolute values:\n",
    "numbers = [-5, -2, 0, 3, -1, 4]\n",

    "In the above example, the `sorted()` function is used to sort the `numbers` list. The `key` parameter specifies a function that calculates the sorting criterion. Instead of defining a regular function using `def`, a lambda function is used as the sorting criterion. The lambda function `lambda x: abs(x)` takes a single parameter `x` and returns the absolute value of `x`. This lambda function is passed as the `key` argument to the `sorted()` function, which sorts the numbers based on their absolute values.\n",
    "Lambda functions are useful in situations where you need a short, one-time function without the need to define a regular function separately. They are commonly used with higher-order functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`, where a simple function is required as an argument."
